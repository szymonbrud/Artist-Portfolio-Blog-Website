# üé® Artist Portfolio & Blog Website (Gatsby)

This repository contains the source code for a website created for an artist to **showcase their portfolio of works** and publish **blog posts or news updates**.

## ‚ú® Project Context: An Early Dive into Modern Web

This project was developed a while ago when I was learning Design and Coding full websites. Building this platform allowed me to gain practical experience with:

*   Creating dynamic static sites using **Gatsby.js**.
*   Integrating a powerful Headless CMS like **Contentful** for flexible content management (allowing the artist to update content easily).
*   Styling components with **Styled Components** for a clean and maintainable codebase.

It represents a key project from my earlier development journey, demonstrating my ability to build a functional, content-driven website using these tools.

## üì± Key Features

*   **Portfolio Display:** Sections dedicated to showcasing the artist's various works.
*   **Blog/News Section:** A place for the artist to share updates, thoughts, or news.
*   **Content Managed by CMS:** Content is fetched from Contentful, separating content from code.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** The website is designed to look and function well across **all device sizes**, from desktops to tablets and **mobile phones**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Project Status

Please be aware that this project was developed **some time ago** and relies on **older versions of its dependencies** (Gatsby,etc.).

Consequently, attempting to run this project in its current state **will likely require significant effort** to update dependencies and resolve compatibility issues.

While not immediately runnable without substantial updates, the codebase serves as a **historical example of my work** with these technologies and demonstrates the original architecture, styling, and content integration approach.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Gatsby.js:** The static site generator framework based on React.
*   **Contentful:** The Headless CMS used for content management.
*   **Styled Components:** For component-based styling.
